Crystal Collector Game!

You will be given a random number at the start of the game.

There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.

You will win the game by matching your total score to the random number, and you lose if you go over that number.

The value of each gemstone will remain hidden until they are clicked on.

When a new game starts, the new game will change the values of the crystals.
